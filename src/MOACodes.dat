If you believe the service should have been fully covered as billed, or if you did not know and *could not reasonably have been expected to know that we would not pay for this level of service, or if you *notified the patient in writing in advance that we would not pay for this level of service and he/she agreed *in writing to pay, ask us to review your claim within 120 days of the date of this notice.

M26~Payment has been adjusted because the information furnished does not substantiate the need for this level of *service. If you have collected any amount from the patient for this level of service /any amount that *exceeds the limiting charge for the less extensive service, the law requires you to refund that amount to the *patient within 30 days of receiving this notice.  The law permits exceptions to the refund requirement in two *cases:  If you did not know, and could not have reasonably been expected to know, that we would not pay for this *service; or  If you notified the patient in writing before providing the service that you believed that we were *likely to deny the service, and the patient signed a statement agreeing to pay for the service.  If you come *within either exception, or if you believe the carrier was wrong in its determination that we do not pay for *this service, you should request review of this determination within 30 days of the date of this notice.  *Your request for review should include any additional information necessary to support your position.  If you *request review within 30 days of receiving this notice, you may delay refunding the amount to the patient until *you receive the results of the review.  If the review decision is favorable to you, you do not need to make *any refund.  If, however, the review is unfavorable, the law specifies that you must make the refund within *15 days of receiving the unfavorable review decision.  The law also permits you to request review at any *time within 120 days of the date of this notice.  However, a review request that is received more than *30 days after the date of this notice, does not permit you to delay making the refund.  *Regardless of when a review is requested, the patient will be notified that you have requested one, and will *receive a copy of the determination.  The patient has received a separate notice of this denial decision.  *The notice advises that he/she may be entitled to a refund of any amounts paid, if you should have known that we *would not pay and did not tell him/her.  It also instructs the patient to contact your office if he/she *does not hear anything about a refund within 30 days.  The requirements for refund are in 1842(l) of the *Social Security Act and 42CFR411.408.  The section specifies that physicians who knowingly and willfully *fail to make appropriate refunds may be subject to civil monetary penalties and/or exclusion from the program. *Please contact this office if you have any questions about this notice.
M27~The patient has been relieved of liability of payment of these items and services under the limitation of *liability provision of the law.  You, the provider, are ultimately liable for the patient's waived charges, *including any charges for coinsurance, since the items or services were not reasonable and necessary or *constituted custodial care, and you knew or could reasonably have been expected to know, that they were not covered.  *You may appeal this determination provided that the patient does not exercise his/her appeal rights.  If the *beneficiary appeals the initial determination, you are automatically made a party to the appeals determination.  *If, however, the patient or his/her representative has stated in writing that he/she does not intend to request *a reconsideration, or the patient's liability was entirely waived in the initial determination, you may *initiate an appeal.  You may ask for a reconsideration for hospital insurance (or a review for medical *insurance) regarding both the coverage determination and the issue of whether you exercised due care.  The request *for reconsideration must be filed within 120 days of the date of this notice (or, for a medical insurance *review, within 120 days of the date of this notice).  You may make the request through any Social Security office *or through this office.
